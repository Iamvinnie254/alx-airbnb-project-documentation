## Setup Note

Enable UUID generation in PostgreSQL before running migrations:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
```

### Outcome

The backend system supports all necessary **Airbnb-like operations** — from user management to secure payment processing.  

Relationships between entities such as **users**, **properties**, **bookings**, and **payments** are validated automatically.  

This dataset and backend logic are ideal for testing frontend integrations, running API demos, and developing additional modules.
